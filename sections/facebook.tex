\section{Facebook login}

In QuizFight, a user can challenge her friends on Facebook.
Although we could have let a user to search an adversary among her Google
contacts, we preferred to give her the possibility to log in with Facebook.
This decision is based on the observation that probably a person has more
friends on Facebook than contacts on Google.

In \texttt{HomeActivity}, a user can log in with Facebook and then, in

\texttt{StartDuelActivity} she can take a look at the list of
Facebook friends and choose one as adversary. \\

QuizFight requires the user\_friends permission in order to display the
list of a user's Facebook friends.

When a user log in with Facebook, her Facebook id is sent to the server and
saved to the correspondent user entry.

Then, when a user challenge a Facebook friend, the Facebook id of the friend
is retrieved and used to find the correspondent GGame username.
Finally, the duel can start.
