\section{Known issues}\label{sec:issues}
Currently, only authorized users are able to sign in, both with Facebook and
Google. In fact, since QuizFight has not been published, only the developers
may log in. This is not a limitation in the common sense, since once published
the problem disappears. Anyhow, until then, we have to explicitly whitelist
every user via both Google and Facebook Identity and Access Management's engines. 

Google imposes some limitations on what an application may do without
publication. In particular, it doesn't allow us to populate leaderboard and
events. The former is used for showing the current ranks. The latter are used
for statistics purposes (see \texttt{StatsActivity}). Fortunately, for them we
can also use SavedGames, computing by hand the required information. Nonetheless,
for the leaderboard, there is no way to do that without requiring a dedicated
server's API, which we consider a useless effort. The code for managing ranks
is directly provided by Google, so we are sure it works. Publishing QuizFight
would allow users to see their position in the worldwide rank and even dare top
players. Without publication, anyway, Google disallow this feature.
