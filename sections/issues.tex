Currently, only authorized users are able to sign in, both with Facebook and
Google. In fact, since QuizFight has not been published, only the developers
may log in. This is not a limitation in the common sense, since once published
the problem disappears. Anyhow, until then, we have to explicitly whitelist
every user via both Google and Facebook Identity and Access Management's engines.
Furthermore, since the authorization process requires an SSH key to be used, 
even the actual Android Studio's instance must be allowed to execute
the application.
