\section{Known issues}\label{sec:issues}
Currently, only authorized users are able to sign in, both with Facebook and
Google. In fact, since QuizFight has not been published, only the developers
may log in. This is not a limitation in the common sense, since once published
the problem disappears. Anyhow, until then, we have to explicitly whitelist
every user via both Google and Facebook Identity and Access Management's engines.
Furthermore, since the authorization process requires an SSH key to be used, 
even the actual Android Studio's instance must be allowed to execute
the application. \\

As QuizFight has not been published, Google disables some features, such as the
Events saving. We make use of Events for storing statistics about the duels, 
such as how much duels, or rounds, the player has won versus the total number
of duels or rounds. Unfortunately, Google stores Event's information only after
the publication, so we are not able to show the actual user's data. This is the 
reason why, in \texttt{StatsActivity}, we provide a fake view. In this way it
is possible to see how, once published, the UI will look like.
